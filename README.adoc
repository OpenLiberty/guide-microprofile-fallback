= Building fault-tolerant microservices with the @Fallback annotation

[.hidden]
NOTE: This repository contains the guide documentation source. To view the guide in published form, view it on the https://openliberty.io/guides/{projectid}.html[Open Liberty website].

You'll explore how to manage the impact of failures using MicroProfile Fault Tolerance by adding fallback behavior to microservice dependencies.

== What you'll learn

You will learn how to use MicroProfile (MP) Fault Tolerance to build resilient microservices that reduce the impact from failure and ensure continued operation of services.

MP Fault Tolerance provides a simple and flexible solution to build fault-tolerant microservices. Fault tolerance leverages different strategies to guide the execution and result of logic. As stated in the https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-fault-tolerance[MicroProfile website^], retry policies, bulkheads, and circuit breakers are popular concepts in this area. They dictate whether and when executions take place, and fallbacks offer an alternative result when an execution does not complete successfully.

The application that you will be working with is an `inventory` service, which collects, stores, and returns the system properties. It uses the `system` service to retrieve the system properties for a particular host. You will add fault tolerance to the `inventory` service so that it reacts accordingly when the `system` service is unavailable.

You will use the `@Fallback` annotations from the MicroProfile Fault Tolerance specification to define criteria for when to provide an alternative solution for a failed execution.

You will also see the application metrics for the fault tolerance methods that are automatically enabled when you add the MicroProfile Metrics feature to the server.

The MicroProfile Fault Tolerance API is included in the MicroProfile dependency that is specified in your [hotspot file=4]`pom.xml` file. Look for the dependency with the [hotspot=microprofile file=4]`microprofile` artifact ID. This dependency provides a library that allows you to use fault tolerance policies in your microservices.

You can also find the [hotspot=mpFaultTolerance file=3]`mpFaultTolerance` feature in your [hotspot file=3]`src/main/liberty/config/server.xml` server configuration, which turns on MicroProfile Fault Tolerance capabilities in Open Liberty.

To easily work through this guide, the two provided microservices are set up to run on the same server. To simulate the availability of the services and then to enable fault tolerance, dynamic configuration with MicroProfile Configuration is used so that you can easily take one service or the other down for maintenance. If you want to learn more about setting up dynamic configuration, see https://openliberty.io/guides/microprofile-config.html[Configuring microservices^].

The following two steps set up the dynamic configuration on the `system` service and its client. You can move on to the next section, which adds the fallback mechanism on the `inventory` service.

First, the [hotspot file=0]`src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/system/SystemResource.java` file has the [hotspot=isInMaintenance file=0]`isInMaintenance()` condition, which determines that the system properties are returned only if you set the [hotspot=2 file=1]`io_openliberty_guides_system_inMaintenance` configuration property to `false` in the [hotspot file=1]`CustomConfigSource` file. Otherwise, the service returns a [hotspot=response-status file=0]`Status.SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` message, which makes it unavailable.

Next, the [hotspot file=2]`src/main/java/io/openliberty/guides/inventory/client/SystemClient.java` file makes a request to the `system` service through the MicroProfile Rest Client API. If you want to learn more about MicroProfile Rest Client, you can follow the https://openliberty.io/guides/microprofile-rest-client.html[Consuming RESTful services with template interfaces^] guide. The `system` service as described in the [hotspot file=0]`SystemResource.java` file may return a [hotspot=response-status file=0]`Status.SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` message, which is a 503 status code. This code indicates that the server being called is unable to handle the request because of a temporary overload or scheduled maintenance, which would likely be alleviated after some delay. To simulate that the system is unavailable, an [hotspot=IOException file=2]`IOException` is thrown.

The `InventoryManager` class calls the [hotspot=getProperties file=2]`getProperties()` method in the [hotspot file=2]`SystemClient.java` class. You will look into the `InventoryManager` class in more detail in the next section.

=== Adding the @Fallback annotation

The `inventory` service is now able to recognize that the `system` service was taken down for maintenance. An IOException is thrown to simulate the `system` service is unavailable. Now, set a fallback method to deal with this failure.

----

The [hotspot=Fallback]`@Fallback` annotation dictates a method to call when the original method encounters a failed execution. In this example, use the [hotspot=fallbackForGet]`fallbackForGet()` method.

The [hotspot=Fallback]`@Fallback` annotation provides two parameters, [hotspot=applyOn]`applyOn` and [hotspot=skipOn]`skipOn`, which allow you to configure which exceptions trigger a fallback and which exceptions do not, respectively. In this example, the [hotspot=get]`get()` method throws `IOException` when the system service is unavailable, and throws `UnknownHostException` when the system service cannot be found on the specified host. The [hotspot=fallbackForGet]`fallbackForGet()` method can handle the first case, but not the second.

The [hotspot=fallbackForGet]`fallbackForGet()` method, which is the designated fallback method for the original [hotspot=get]`get()` method, checks to see if the system's properties exist in the inventory. If the system properties entry is not found in the inventory, the method prints out a warning message in the browser. Otherwise, this method returns the cached property values from the inventory.

You successfully set up your microservice to have fault tolerance capability.


== Enabling metrics for the fault tolerance methods

server.xml
[source, xml, linenums, role='code_column']

MicroProfile Fault Tolerance integrates with MicroProfile Metrics to provide metrics for the annotated fault tolerance methods. When both the [hotspot=mpFaultTolerance]`mpFaultTolerance` and the [hotspot=mpMetrics]`mpMetrics` features are included in the [hotspot]`server.xml` configuration file, the `@Fallback` fault tolerance annotation provides metrics that count the following things: the total number of annotated method invocations, the total number of failed annotated method invocations, and the total number of the fallback method calls.

The [hotspot=mpMetrics]`mpMetrics` feature requires SSL and the configuration is provided for you. The [hotspot=quickStartSecurity]`quickStartSecurity` configuration element provides basic security to secure the server. When you go to the `/metrics` endpoint, use the credentials that are defined in the server configuration to log in to view the data for the fault tolerance methods.

You can learn more about MicroProfile Metrics in the https://openliberty.io/guides/microprofile-metrics.html[Providing metrics from a microservice^] guide. You can also learn more about the MicroProfile Fault Tolerance and MicroProfile Metrics integration in the https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-fault-tolerance/releases[MicroProfile Fault Tolerance specification^].

When the server is running, point your browser to the http://localhost:9080/inventory/systems/localhost[http://localhost:9080/inventory/systems/localhost^] URL. You receive the system properties of your local JVM from the `inventory` service. 

Next, point your browser to the `system` service URL,  which is located at http://localhost:9080/system/properties[http://localhost:9080/system/properties^], to retrieve the system properties for the specific localhost. Notice that the results from the two URLs are identical because the `inventory` service gets its results from calling the `system` service.

To see the application metrics, go to the https://localhost:9443/metrics/base[https://localhost:9443/metrics/base^] URL. Log in as the `admin` user, and use `adminpwd` as the password. See the following sample outputs for the `@Fallback` annotated method and the fallback method before a fallback occurs:

You can test your application manually, but automated tests ensure code quality because they trigger a failure whenever a code change introduces a defect. JUnit and the JAX-RS Client API provide a simple environment for you to write tests.

The [hotspot=Before]`@BeforeEach` and [hotspot=After]`@AfterEach` annotations indicate that this method runs either before or after the other test case. These methods are generally used to perform any setup and teardown tasks. In this case, the setup method creates a JAX-RS client, which makes HTTP requests to the `inventory` service. This client must also be registered with a JSON-P provider to process JSON resources. The teardown method simply destroys this client instance as well as the HTTP responses.

The [hotspot=testFallbackForGet]`testFallbackForGet()` test case sends a request to the `inventory` service to get the systems properties for a hostname before and after the `system` service becomes unavailable. Then, it asserts outputs from the two requests to ensure that they are different from each other.

The [hotspot=testFallbackSkipForGet]`testFallbackSkipForGet()` test case sends a request to the `inventory` service to get the system properties for an incorrect hostname (`unknown`). Then, it confirms that the fallback method has not been called by asserting that the response's status code is `404` with an error message in the response body.

The [hotspot=Test1 hotspot=Test2]`@Test` annotations indicate that the methods automatically execute when your test class runs.

In addition, a few endpoint tests have been included for you to test the basic functionality of the `inventory` and `system` services. If a test failure occurs, then you might have introduced a bug into the code.
